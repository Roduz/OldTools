Usage:

FrameViewer only reads either PNG or PCX files.

The following methods will work with FrameViewer:

-Create a .bat file with a command line and path argument, C:\Skullgirls\trunk\ArtAssets\cerebella\data\idle\stand_idle\frames C:\Skullgirls\trunk\ArtAssets\cerebella\palettes cerebella 64 for example.

-Type Frameviewer and the path of the images from the command prompt.

-Create a shortcut and add the path argument in the target.

-For Palettes add in the directory of the palette files after the directory to the frames

frameViewer C:\Skullgirls\trunk\ArtAssets\cerebella\data\idle\stand_idle\frames C:\Skullgirls\trunk\ArtAssets\cerebella\palettes 64

frameViewer (Path os the frame files) (path of the palette files) (name of the pmap file without the extension) (the size you want the color table to be, higher is more gradient)

Note that FrameViewer looks for a .txt file to read first and will try to parse from it, breaking if the format is not reconized.
Lines can be commented out by typing a "#" at the begining of a line and the text should follow this format "idle01 - (1065, 1151) [4]"
*Also it will pull the file names from there so if the name does not match with the file name, nothing will be shown.
