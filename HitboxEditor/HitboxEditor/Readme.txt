Hitbox Editor Alpha

To install run the installer. It installs some Microsoft folder, and can be
uninstalled through the control panel. It should install the nessecary libraries
as well. I included the .exe and the Content folder with the font file it uses.
After running the installer you can use the HitboxEditor.exe and the Content folder
and copy them anywhere.

Please note that the program will crash is there are no .FRM and .lines.pcx
files in the directory it is at or targeting if using a shortcut.
Also note that it requires Content folder to be in the same directory
as the .EXE. other than that after installing the program
can be moved around. Once the editor is running, press F1 for help.
