Prerequisite
XNA 4.0 framework or run the XNALibraryInstall setup.exe
FrameDumper needs this aswell as Frameviewer.

Instructions

Make a *.bat file (basically a text file with the .bat extension)
Name it for the character and the palette used (not necessary but prefered)

Edit the file to have the following:
FrameBatchMaker "directory of character frames" "name of the pmap file" "name of the palette file" "quality of the palette to generate (64 is good)" "true/false to display the frames during the conversion"

For example:
FrameBatchMaker C:\Skullgirls\trunk\ArtAssets\filia filia filia_2p 64 true

Run the .bat file, a window should come up and display the valid directories of all the animation frames then close.

In the same folder a new .bat will have been created.
"_export_(character name)_(pal number).bat"
for example "_export_squigly_4p.bat"

Run that .bat file then 2 windows should appear, first a command text window, then depending on the display flag, false for a small gray window or true for a window that has the frames shown.

Do not close the windows, you may move the text window, just let it do it's thing unless;

For Valentine it crashes at the operation animation, just close the gray window/frame display window (not the black text command window) then it should just pick up at the next frames. Reason is that the operation cine frames have different resolutions.

Once the process has completed all the windows will close and there should be a folder in the same directory of the exe with the character name.
Inside the folder structure is the same as the folder it grabbed the frames and they have been saved to PNGs.

Tested on most characters but if there is a bug email me and I might fix it but it's least likely.
